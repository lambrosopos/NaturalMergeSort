# NaturalMergeSort

index.html visualises how Natural Merge Sort works in general

algorithm.js is a possible Javascript implementation

## Basic idea
Initially sorted elements do not need to be sorted again.
In the worst case, Natural Merge Sort has the same speed as Merge Sort.

To simplify understanding, this implementation uses recursion
and does not take advantage of all possible optimisations.
